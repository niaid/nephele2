# Nephele: Microbiome Analysis

Nephele: Microbiome Analysis is a web-based platform for microbiome data analysis. It is developed and maintained by a team from the Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology ([OCICB](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/cyber-infrastructure-computational-biology-contacts)), which is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

## About this repository

The purpose of this repository is to allow Nephele users and others interested in microbiome analysis to examine how we use various software tools within the Nephele v2.0 platform. This repository contains the code related to the website with user-facing interactions for the platform and the data analysis pipeline scripts that Nephele executes on the Amazon cloud to process sequence data inputs provided by users. The bioinformatics tools used by the pipelines need to be installed separately, and are listed in individual pipeline READMEs and reference sections.
