      	<li><strong>Paired End:</strong> Paired-end sequencing involves sequencing DNA from both ends of a fragment.
      			    Choose this option if your sequence files are paired and have been demultiplexed. For example, Illumina MiSeq Paired End 
      			    fastq files consist of two files for each sample with names ending on “R1_001.fastq” and “R2_001.fastq”</li>
        <li><strong>Single End:</strong> Single-end sequencing involves sequencing DNA from only one end. 
        			Choose this option if your samples only got sequenced from one end or if you don’t want to use the reverse fastq file.</li>
        <!-- li><strong>FASTA and QUAL:</strong> FASTA file is sometimes accompanied by a QUAL file, particularly 
        			when the FASTA file contains sequences generated from a high-throughput sequencing platform. 
        			QUAL file stores a Phred quality score (nonnegative integer) for each base in a sequence stored in FASTA format.</li-->
